This repository contains three programs:

1. **`detect_video.ipynb`**  
    This program is designed to be executed as a Jupyter Notebook.

2. **`detect_video_sreamlit.py`**  
RUN `pip3 install streamlit openai-clip` before using this demo.
This is a Python script that is expected to be executed as a Streamlit program using the command `streamlit run detect_video_streamlit.py`.  
It is designed to detect people or vehicles, similar to the first program, but implemented in a Streamlit interface.
It also utilizes the YOLO-World model to detect objects specified by the user.
